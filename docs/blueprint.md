# **App Name**: QR Spark

## Core Features:

- QR Code Generation: Generate QR codes from URLs or text input, with options for customization.
- Visual Customization: Customize QR code appearance, including colors for dots, background, and corners. Choose styles for dots and corners. Toggling the overlaying of the logo using the 'tool' helps the generator decide if the dots should be hidden behind the logo.
- Logo Integration: Allow users to upload their logo and integrate it into the QR code, adjusting size, margin, and the option to hide points behind the logo for better readability.
- Error Correction Level: Configure the error correction level to balance data density and scannability, especially when a logo is present.
- Download in Multiple Formats: Offer options to download the generated QR code in SVG, PNG, JPEG, and WEBP formats to support different use cases like print and web.

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#9D4EDD) to convey creativity and uniqueness, complementing the customization aspect of the QR codes.
- Background color: A light lavender (#E9D5FF), offering a gentle contrast to the primary color while maintaining a consistent theme.
- Accent color: A softer lilac (#C8B6FF) to highlight interactive elements without overpowering the overall design.
- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, will be used throughout the application for a clean, modern, and fashionable look.
- A clean and intuitive layout, inspired by award-winning digital creative agencies. Mobile-first approach to ensure functionality on all devices.
- Simple, consistent icons will represent different features and file formats to guide users through the app. It should enhance usability without adding clutter.
